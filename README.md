# Smart Pet Feeder


This Arduino Smart Pet Feeder was a protoype embedded system implmemented for my Senior Design Project.


The purpose of this project is to feed your pet away from home without monitoring


This Protoype was implemented using Arduino, C++, and I2C Programming Languages. 


This saves time, especially when feeding the pet without any concerns.
